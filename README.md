# Sea-Ice-Segmentation--GRIMP-GLCM-CNN
Classification of sea ice and water in SAR imagery using a CNN and K-Means clustering for pseudo-labeling. It extracts image windows and GLCM features, normalizes and quantizes images, and generates a prediction map for visualization. This approach enhances the analysis and understanding of ice and water regions in the dataset.
